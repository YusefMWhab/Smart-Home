- **Buzzer**  
  Generates audible alerts or notifications for certain events or user interactions.

- **Door Locker (Smart Home)**  
  Allows users to lock and unlock their home door remotely using Bluetooth commands.

- **H-Bridge L982N**  
  An essential electronic circuit used to control the direction of current flow, commonly used for driving DC motors in both directions.

- **LCD Display**  
  Provides a user-friendly interface to display system status, instructions, and feedback.

- **Resistors and Breadboard / PCB**  
  For circuit connections and component protection.

- **Power Supply**  
  Powers the entire system reliably.
